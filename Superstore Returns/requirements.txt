The Superstore Returns project simulates a  mock consulting engagement to analyze and reduce customer returns for the Superstore.  

The analysis explores potential root causes of returns, including correlations with sales, product category, customer behavior, geographic location, and time. 

It leverages calculated fields and visualizations to identify key drivers of return rates. 

The project culminates in the design and implementation of an interactive dashboard to monitor returns and facilitate data-driven decision-making. 

A presentation summarizing the analysis, dashboard functionality, and recommended actions is also included.
