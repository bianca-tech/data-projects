This project analyzes Superstore sales data to provide actionable insights into profitability, advertising strategies, and product returns. 

Key investigations include identifying profit/loss centers and discontinuing underperforming products, optimizing advertising spend based on ROAS, and analyzing product/customer return rates. 

Data visualizations, including geographic maps, scatter plots, seasonality charts, and bar charts, reveal key trends and support data-driven decisions.

The included Tableau dashboard visually summarizes return rate analysis, highlighting geographic patterns, sales correlations, seasonality, and category-specific return rates.  

This analysis utilizes the [Superstore sales data] and was created using [Tableau].[HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/sprint5storytellingwithdata/Story1returnrate?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
