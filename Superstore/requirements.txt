The Superstore project simulates a consulting engagement to revitalize the Superstore's declining profitability.

Using data analysis and visualization, the project identifies key profit and loss centers, recommending specific products to discontinue and subcategories to prioritize.

Furthermore, it evaluates the potential of advertising by pinpointing optimal state/month combinations and suggesting advertising budget strategies based on return on ad spend.

Finally, the analysis examines returned items, identifying products and customers with high return rates and exploring the relationship between profitability and return rates to inform strategic business decisions. 

The project delivers actionable insights to help the Superstore avoid bankruptcy and maximize profitability.
