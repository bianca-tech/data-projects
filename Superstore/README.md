This Superstore analysis project identifies key profit and loss centers, optimizes advertising strategies, and analyzes product returns to improve profitability. 

The project pinpoints top profit/loss drivers, recommends products and subcategories for discontinuation, and suggests optimal state/month combinations for advertising based on ROAS.

Return rate analysis identifies problematic products and customers, exploring the relationship between returns and profitability. 

Visualizations are used throughout to justify conclusions and support data-driven recommendations for the Superstore to avoid bankruptcy. 

My contribution to this dashboard includes the creation of the "Avg. Profit vs. Avg. Return" scatter plot. 
This visualization allows for a direct comparison of average profit and average return rates for each shipping mode (First Class, Same Day, Second Class, and Standard Class).
By plotting these two key metrics against each other, I aimed to highlight any correlations or trade-offs between shipping speed, profitability, and returns.

This analysis leverages Superstore Data and Tableau used.[HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/README_md_17336089985300/Avgproftvs_Avgreturn?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
