This e-commerce analysis project explores user behavior and retention to optimize business strategies.  

I created a conversion funnel to analyze the drop-off in user engagement from product views to purchases, calculating conversion rates at each stage. 

I also prepared data for cohort analysis, filtering purchase events, calculating first purchase dates, and structuring data by month to track user retention. 

Finally, I calculated and visualized cohort retention rates, summarizing key findings and analysis details in an executive summary within the provided Google Sheet
