This project analyzes Chicago taxi ride data for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company, to identify patterns in passenger preferences and the impact of external factors. 

Using a provided database, the analysis explores ride frequency by taxi company, specifically focusing on Yellow and Blue companies and the top two companies (Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services).

Furthermore, the project investigates the correlation between weather conditions (rain/storm) and ride duration for trips between the Loop and O'Hare International Airport on Saturdays.

The analysis leverages SQL queries to extract and aggregate data from the trips, cabs, neighborhoods, and weather_records tables, providing insights into operational strategies and potential market opportunities for Zuber.
