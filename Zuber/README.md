The name of the project
A concise, one-line description that explains its purpose
A link to the live webpage or GitHub
A link to the repositories with your project’s code on GitHub
3-5 bullet points on the project that answer the following questions: What did you build and why? What problem did it solve?
What technologies did you use? How many weeks/months did it take to complete? 
How many people took part in the project and what was your contribution?
Optional but highly recommended: A demo video of the different features of the site.
It should showcase what your code actually does and prove that it’s functional. 
Try to make a video that showcases what the user will see in real time and give it a max length of 3-4 minutes. 
Ideally, you should also create a voiceover for the demo. More on recording a project demo here.
