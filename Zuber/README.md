Key areas of investigation:

* **Passenger Preferences:**  Analysis of trip data to understand popular pickup and dropoff locations, trip durations, and distances.
* **Competitor Analysis:** Examination of cab data to understand the competitive landscape, including the number of vehicles operated by different companies.
* **Weather Impact:** Correlation analysis between weather conditions and ride frequency to understand how weather affects demand.
