# FRESH BEATS PROJECT


##  This project analyzes user engagement across different music genres over time to identify trends and inform strategic decisions.

Visualized user engagement by genre and year, revealing a significant increase in Pop music engagement from 2018 to 2023.

I built a table and a line chart displaying the average number of users for each music genre (Electronic, Hip-Hop, Indie, Pop, Rock) from 2018 to 2023. This was done to understand user engagement patterns and identify popular genres over time.

The project addressed the need to understand user preferences for different music genres and how these preferences have evolved over time. This information can be used to inform decisions related to content creation, marketing, and platform development.

Google Sheets was used to organize and analyze the data, and likely for creating the visualizations.

 I completed the project within 2 weeks 

HOW MANY PEOPLE TOOK PART IN THE PROJECT AND WHAT WAS YOUR CONTRIBUTION? (This solo project analyzed provided insights and visualizations to address key business challenges for a music platform.  It focused on evaluating artist promotion effectiveness, enhancing user engagement and conversion to paid subscriptions, and improving genre promotion for emerging artists.  My role was to synthesize the available data and connect it to these challenges, identifying factors influencing successful promotions, user conversion, and targeted genre recommendations. )

### Conclusions:

Pop music shows a consistent upward trend in user engagement over the six years.
Rock music also shows an upward trend, although less pronounced than Pop.
Electronic and Hip-Hop show fluctuations but generally maintain a similar level of engagement.
Indie shows a moderate increase in engagement.
### Recommendations:

Capitalize on the growing popularity of Pop music by featuring it prominently on the platform and creating more content in this genre.
Invest in Rock music content to cater to the increasing user base in this genre.
Maintain focus on Electronic and Hip-Hop to retain existing users in these genres.
Explore opportunities to further engage Indie music users and potentially increase their engagement.
Conduct further research to understand the factors driving the trends observed in each genre. This could include user demographics, listening habits, and external factors.
