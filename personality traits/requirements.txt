# Part 2. Rules & Criteria Data Analysis

## Part 1: EDA

In this stage of the project, you should decide with your team what aspect of the dataset youâ€™d like to explore and display.

You should choose one of the datasets and conduct EDA on it. Some of the datasets will require different methods of preprocessing. Keep in mind that you may need to:

- Join tables
- Remove or fill in missing values
- Regroup data in order to focus on particular elements
- Create new columns for analyzing the data

## Part 2: Visualisation

After exploring the data, you need to decide on different ways to visualize the data. Each of your visualizations should be unique. 

## Part 3: Reporting Results - Presentation

While visualizations are very useful for pointing out important features of a dataset, they are not sufficient for a full data analysis. The last stage of your work must be creating a presentation with the results. 

You must include:

- An introduction to the dataset
    - What data do you have?
    - What did you do?
    - What are your major findings, briefly?
- Explanations of visualization, explaining, giving broader context, and drawing conclusions
- A conclusion, indicating what further explorations might be made into the dataset
