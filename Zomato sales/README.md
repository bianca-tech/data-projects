## ZOMATO SALES

## THIS PROJECT ANALYZES ZOMATO SALES DATA TO UNDERSTAND TRENDS AND INFORM BUSINESS DECISIONS. 

Visualized monthly sales trends, revealing August as the highest-performing month with an average sales amount of $7.5K.

 I built a dashboard displaying key sales metrics, including total revenue, sales quantity, monthly sales trends, top-performing cities, and cuisines. The goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of Zomato's sales performance.

The project addressed the need to understand Zomato's sales patterns, identify top performers, and inform strategies to improve overall revenue.

The dashboard was created using Tableau.

The following project took 2 1/2 weeks to complete

My team lead checked my solo project for compliance with the criteria to complete a report and the onboarding process. My contribution was to create a dashboard based on findings from working with data in the format of a report. Also, I analyzed the business performance in sales.

Conclusions:

August exhibits the highest average monthly sales.
Tirupati and Sirsi are top-performing cities in terms of revenue.
Sweets, Tandoor, and Biryani are popular cuisine choices.

Recommendation:

Investigate the factors contributing to August's high sales performance and replicate them in other months.
Focus marketing efforts on Tirupati and Sirsi while exploring growth opportunities in other cities.
Leverage the popularity of Sweets, Tandoor, and Biryani cuisines to optimize menu offerings and promotions.
Further analysis could explore the relationship between cuisine popularity and city-level performance. [HERE] (https://public.tableau.com/views/zomatofinalproject_17386205456730/Summary?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
