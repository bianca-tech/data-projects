## SHOPIFY PROJECT
## This project analyzes app store data to understand user preferences and inform app development strategy. THIS PROJECT ANALYZES APP STORE DATA TO UNDERSTAND USER PREFERENCES AND INFORM APP DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. 

Identified a correlation between review count and average rating, demonstrating that apps with more reviews tend to have higher average ratings.

I built a series of visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, and KPI cards, to explore app store data. The goal was to uncover insights about app popularity, user engagement, and developer activity.

The project addressed the need to understand user preferences and market trends in the app store, enabling data-driven decisions for app development and marketing.

The technologies used was Power BI 

 Timeframe was 2 weeks 

SHOPIFY was a solo project with me contributing to creating visuals for KPI Card, Line Chart, scatterplots, and other data models. 

Conclusions:

A significant portion of apps have a low number of reviews (under 10,000).
Average ratings tend to cluster between 4 and 5 stars.
There's a positive correlation between the number of reviews and the average rating.
User engagement, measured by helpful reviews, varies across developers.
Recommendations:

Focus on acquiring more reviews for apps to potentially increase visibility and average rating.
Investigate the factors contributing to higher user engagement (helpful reviews) for successful developers.
Further analysis could explore the relationship between app categories, pricing, and user behavior.
