This Shopify app landscape analysis project explores key success factors using data scraped from the Shopify App Store. 
The analysis covers app landscape statistics, review sentiment, and developer responsiveness.
Key metrics include the number of unique apps, review trends over time, the relationship between review count and average rating, and the impact of developer engagement on reviews.
DAX calculations were used to create weighted review scores and identify developer responses. 
Visualizations, including KPI cards, line charts, scatter plots, and bar charts, are used to present findings across the three report pages: App Landscape, Reviews, and App Reviews.
