This project simulates a  mock consulting engagement to analyze Airbnb data to advise a client on optimal vacation rental investments.
Using review counts as a proxy for rental frequency, the analysis identifies the top 10 most attractive neighborhoods and the most popular property sizes (number of bedrooms) within those neighborhoods. 
The project then calculates the revenue generated by these top-performing listings, providing data-driven recommendations for investment strategies. 
Key steps include data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and revenue calculation using the Airbnb listings and calendar datasets. 
The final output ranks top listings by revenue, enabling targeted investment recommendations.
